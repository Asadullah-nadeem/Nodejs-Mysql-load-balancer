# Nodejs-Mysql-load-balancer
A Node.js project that demonstrates how to set up load balancing using MySQL databases. It includes a simple server to handle user data with both master and slave databases. Users can add new data and view it, while the server ensures that read operations are distributed across slave databases for better performance.
